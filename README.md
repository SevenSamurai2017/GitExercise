## Description
Here we have implemented the game of TicTacToe, where two users can play this classic game as X and O. The players take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

However, the main focus of this project is the general infrastructure and coding practices involved. 

This project was developed using Sublime Text 3 and IntelliJ as development environments, GitHub for version control, Travis CI for continuous integration and Heroku for the deployment and production environment.
