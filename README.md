# TicTacToe

#### Software Engineering (C-T-303-HUGB), Week 10 Fall Semester 2017

Here we have implemented the game of TicTacToe, where two users can play this classic game. However, the main focus of this project is the general infrastructure and coding practices involved. 

This project was developed using Sublime Text 3 and IntelliJ as development environments, Github for version control, Travis CI for continuous integration and Heroku for the deployment and production environment.
