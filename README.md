# TicTacToe

#### Software Engineering (C-T-303-HUGB), Week 10 Fall Semester 2017

Here we have implemented the game of TicTacToe, where two users can play this classic game as X and O. The players take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

However, the main focus of this project is the general infrastructure and coding practices involved. 

This project was developed using Sublime Text 3 and IntelliJ as development environments, Github for version control, Travis CI for continuous integration and Heroku for the deployment and production environment.
